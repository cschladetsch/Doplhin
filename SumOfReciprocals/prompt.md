# C++20 - Sum of Series of 1/(n^2)

Generate a C++20 program to calcluate the sum series comprised of the reciptrocals of the squares of natual numbers.

## Requirements

1. Hardcode the convegence threshold to 10^-9.
1. Implemenent an efficient solution that does not use iteration.
1. The output should be error written to `stderr` or as a single number written to `stdout`.
1. Use `double` number format internall.
1. **C++20**: Use only standard C++20 features and libraries. Do not use external libraries.
1. **Comments**: Add comments to the code, focusing on "why" and not "how" or "what".
1. **Error Handling**: Use exceptions to deal with errors. When errors are caught, add local contextual extra information then rethrow the exception.
1. Use 5 significant digits in the output.

## Example

```bash
$ ./app 
1.6449
```

## Notes

* The solution must adhere to modern C++20 standards and must not use external libraries.
