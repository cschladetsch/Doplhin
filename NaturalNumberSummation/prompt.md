# Calculate Sum of Natural Numbers

Generate a C++20 program to solve a variation of Euler Problem 1. This finds the sum of all natural numbers below a given limit that are multiples of either 3 or 5.

## Requirements

1. Generate the program using C++20.
1. Accept input from the command line. 
1. Calculate the sum of all natural numbers below the given limit that are multiples of either 3 or 5.
1. Output the sum.
1. Ensue the program handles input and internal errors gracefully.
1. Optimise the algorithm for efficiency in space and time.

## Examples

```bash
$ ./euler-sum 10
23
$ ./euler-sum 20
78
```

## Notes

1. Natural numbers start at one and monotonically increase.
1. The program should include the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 only once in the sum.
