# C++20 - Sum of N Integers

## Overview

Write a C++20 program that calculates the sum of the first N integers efficieitnyl using ranges. The value of N will be passed as a command-line argument to you program.


## Requirements

1. **Ranges**: Prefer using STL algorithms and std::views over `for` loops. 
1. **Comments**: Add comments to the code, focusing on "why" and not "how" or "what".
1. **C++20**: Use only standard C++20 features and libraries. Do not use external libraries.
1. **Error Handling**: Use exceptions to deal with errors. When errors are caught, add local contextual extra information then rethrow the exception.

## Sample Usage

```bash
$ ./sum_of_integers 5
15
$ ./sum_of_integers 10
55
$ ./sum_of_integers 3
6
```

## Notes

* The solution must adhere to modern C++20 standards and must not use external libraries.
* Ensure the program is robust and can handle various edge cases.
* Prioritorise code readability, maintainability, and efficiency in the implementation.
* Provide clear and informative error messages in case of any issues encountered during execution.
