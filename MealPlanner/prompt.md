# C++20 - Meal Planner

Many people wish to limit their daily caloric intake, but find it difficult to do so for various reasons. These include keeping track of calories and als oensuring the diet is not monotonous.

## Problem Statement

Generate a C++20-conformant program that generates a weekly meal plan. Including _breakfast_, _lunch_, _dinner_ and _dessert_ categoris. The data for the food stuffs is provided by a data file in CSV (Comma Separated Value) file. The generated program aims to ensure a balanced and varied intake of meals while meeting a specific daily caloric target.

The challenge is to generate a command-line tool that generates a meal plan, including all meal categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert), from a dataset provided by a CSV file. This program aims to ensure a balanced and varied intake of meals while meeting a specified dailing caloric intake.

Create a tool that automates the construction of a nutrituous and varied weekly meal plan. The must algorithmically select from a dataset of food items - eeach with specified caloric values and meal designations - to adhere to dietary constraints. The result is a user-friedly summary of the meal plan for a full week (Monday to Sunday).

## Requirements

1. **Comments**: Add comments to the code, focusing on "why" and not "how" or "what".
1. **C++20**: Use only standard C++20 features and libraries. Do not use external libraries.
1. **Error Handling**: Use exceptions to deal with errors. When errors are caught, add local contextual extra information then rethrow the exception.

## Provided Framework

```cpp
// include required samples
```

### Driver Code

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // code
    return 0;
}
```

## Sample Usage

```bash
$ ./app args
[output]
```

```bash
$ ./app args2
[output2]
```

## Notes

* The solution must adhere to modern C++20 standards and must not use external libraries.
* Ensure the program is robust and can handle various edge cases.
* Prioritorise code readability, maintainability, and efficiency in the implementation.
* Provide clear and informative error messages in case of any issues encountered during execution.
