# C++20 - Drawing an Ellipse to a File

Generate a modern C++20 program to render an allipse on a grid and save it to a file. 
The program must provide a user-friendly interface for specifying grid dimentsions, ellipse parameters, and the output file.

## Requirements

1. **Ellipse Drawinbg Function**:
1. **File Output**:
1. **Cented Ellipse**:

1. **Comments**: Add comments to the code, focusing on "why" and not "how" or "what".
1. **C++20**: Use only standard C++20 features and libraries. Do not use external libraries.
1. **Error Handling**: Use exceptions to deal with errors. When errors are caught, add local contextual extra information then rethrow the exception.

## Example Driver Code

```cpp
```

## Example Usage

```bash
$ ./app args
[output]
```

## Notes

* The solution must adhere to modern C++20 standards and must not use external libraries.
* Ensure the program is robust and can handle various edge cases.
* Prioritorise code readability, maintainability, and efficiency in the implementation.
* Provide clear and informative error messages in case of any issues encountered during execution.
