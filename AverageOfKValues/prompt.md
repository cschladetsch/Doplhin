# Average of top k Values

## Problem Statement

Given a list of integers, find the average of the largest `k` values.

## Requirements

1. **C++20**: Use only standard C++20 features and libraries. Do not use external libraries.
1. **Use <ranges> library**.
1. **Comments**: Add comments to the code, focusing on "why" and not "how" or "what".
1. **Error Handling**: Use exceptions to deal with errors. When errors are caught, add local contextual extra information then rethrow the exception.
1. **Input**: Take the input from standard input in one line as a sequence of integers, prefixed by a number representing the count of numbers to count.
 * Example: 3 3.5 1.5 3.6
1. **Output**: Write the result to standard output.

## Examples

```bash
$ ./calc_top_average
5 85 90 75 95 80 85 90 92 88 100
92.6
```

## Notes

* Use integer math.
* Only average the largest `k` numbers.
* The solution must adhere to modern C++20 standards and must not use external libraries.
* Ensure the program is robust and can handle various edge cases.
* Prioritorise code readability, maintainability, and efficiency in the implementation.
* Provide clear and informative error messages in case of any issues encountered during execution.
