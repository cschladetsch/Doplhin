# Questions for QTL metting

## Multiplicity

If I were to ask for the generation of an unblanced binary tree, an AVL Tree, a RB Tree, etc, and given randomised input with 1000 samples each, is too that too much?

I assume it is.

So can I break it down? But is there a way to reference or even refer to ppreivous prompts provided?

## Complexity

Are there any written guidelines about what is

- Simple
- Moderate
- Complex

Is there a database of "good" and "bad" prompts?

## Prep work/HubStaff

I usually spend around 30% on raw prep, %30 on editing and entering, and $30 on eval and giving feedback.

Is this typical? Can I put on Hubstaff when I'm just "thinking"?

How invasive is Hubstaff?

## I'm moving into Rust/Asm

Is this Ok?
