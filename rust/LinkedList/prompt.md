# Rust - Singly Linked List

Use Rust to construct a linked list, leveraging interfaces. Linked lists are fundamental, and even though most modern languages offer default implementations, it's good to know how to they work and why.

## Requirements

1. **Define Node**:
1. **Implment NodeTrait Interface**:
1. **Implment Node Methods**:
1. **Comments**: Add comments to the code, focusing on "why" and not "how" or "what".
1. **Rust**: Use only standard modern Rust features and libraries. Do not use external libraries.

## Provided Framework

```
## Sample Usage

```bash
$ ./app args
[output]
```

```bash
$ ./app args2
[output2]
```

## Notes

* The solution must adhere to modern Rust standards and must not use external libraries.
* Ensure the program is robust and can handle various edge cases.
* Prioritorise code readability, maintainability, and efficiency in the implementation.
* Provide clear and informative error messages in case of any issues encountered during execution.
