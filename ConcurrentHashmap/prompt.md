# C++20 - [NAME]

## Problem Statement

## Requirements

1. **Comments**: Add comments to the code, focusing on "why" and not "how" or "what".
1. **C++20**: Use only standard C++20 features and libraries. Do not use external libraries.
1. **Error Handling**: Use exceptions to deal with errors. When errors are caught, add local contextual extra information then rethrow the exception.

## Provided Framework

```cpp
// include required samples
```

### Driver Code

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // code
    return 0;
}
```

## Examples

```bash
$ ./app args
[output]
```

```bash
$ ./app args2
[output2]
```

## Notes

* The solution must adhere to modern C++20 standards and must not use external libraries.
* Ensure the program is robust and can handle various edge cases.
* Prioritorise code readability, maintainability, and efficiency in the implementation.
* Provide clear and informative error messages in case of any issues encountered during execution.
