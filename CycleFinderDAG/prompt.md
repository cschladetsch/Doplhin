# Overview

Develop a robust and scalable C++ program for managing directed graphs with a focus on efficient cycle detection, ensuring memory safety with smart pointer usage and incorporating robust error handling.

## Requirements

1. **Smart Pointer Usage**: Use `std::shared_ptr` to manage node lifetimes and `std::weak_ptr` for node edges, ensuring automated resource management and prevention of memory leaks and circular references.
2. **Graph Operations**:
   - **Node and Edge Management**: Facilitate the addition of new nodes and directed edges, including checks for duplicate entries and invalid references.
   - **Cycle Detection**: Craft an efficient algorithm to ascertain the presence of cycles in the graph, tailored for scalability and performance.
3. **Exception Handling**: Develop a system that adeptly handles exceptions, particularly for erroneous operations like adding edges to non-existent nodes or attempting prohibited actions such as creating disallowed loops.
4. **Single-Threaded**: The generated code can assume that the application is single-threaded.
5. **Scalability**: Engineer the system to support large graphs efficiently, with an emphasis on minimizing space and time complexity and reducing overhead in graph traversal and modifications.

## Class Structures

The following are provided as starting points for the code generation.

### Node Class

Represents individual nodes within the graph, each identifiable by a unique ID and capable of managing outgoing edges with necessary safety checks.

```cpp
class INode {
public:
    explicit INode(int nodeId); // Constructor to initialize the node
    virtual void addEdge(/* parameter defining the target node */) = 0; // Method to add an edge to another node, ensuring error handling for edge validity
    // Placeholder for additional node management methods
};
```

### Graph Class

Oversees the graph's entirety, encompassing nodes, edges, and cycle detection features, all while assuring operational performance.

```cpp
class IGraph {
public:
    virtual void addNode(int id) = 0; // Method to add a new node, ensuring ID uniqueness
    virtual void addEdge(int fromId, int toId) = 0; // Method to create a directed edge, with exception handling for invalid node IDs
    virtual bool detectCycle() = 0; // Method to efficiently identify cycles in the graph
    // Placeholder for additional graph traversal and query methods
};
```

## Example Usage

```cpp
// TODO: Include required headers

// TODO : Generate required Node and Graph classes

class Node : INode {… };

class Graph : IGraph { … };

int main() {
    Graph graph;

    try {
        graph.addNode(1);
        graph.addNode(2);
        graph.addNode(3);

        graph.addEdge(1, 2);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3);
        graph.addEdge(3, 1); // This creates a cycle

        if (graph.detectCycle()) {
            std::cout << "Cycle detected!" << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "No cycles detected." << std::endl;
        }
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Opt for depth-first search (DFS) or another suitable algorithm for cycle detection, optimized according to the graph's anticipated scale.
- Implement comprehensive exception handling to deal with errors during graph operations effectively.
- Design the system to manage a substantial number of nodes and edges adeptly, optimizing for low memory footprint and rapid access patterns.
