Does not include required <map> header.

After adding that, and using the given "new" input, the results are:

```

```
Î» cat in1 | ./ConsoleApplication1.exe
Group 1
- car
- arc
Group 2
- leap
- pale
Group 3
- eat
- tea
```

Which is almost correct.

```
Group 3
- car
- care
- arc
```

Are not anagrams. This is not a problem with my SI as I explicitly stated "using all the original letters exactly once."

However, there is still some ambiguity there. Even so, I feel that the bot should a) understand what an anagram is and b) deduce the correct answer.

I can understand that "car" and "care" could be considered 'anagrams' from my definition. Maybe.

But a) the bot should already know what an anagram is and b) my description of them was clear enough that "car" and "care" should not be considered anagrams.
