"
- dear
- read
- door
"

Are not anagrams. This is not a problem with my SI as I explicitly stated "using all the original letters exactly once."

However, there is still some ambiguity there. Even so, I feel that the bot should a) understand what an anagram is and b) deduce the correct answer.

It should  be clear from the SI that "door" is NOT an anagram of "dear".
