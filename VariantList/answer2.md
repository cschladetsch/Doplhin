The response is badly formatted.

The response is truncated and does not compile.

The code is truncated and has no test driving code.

However, otherwise the methods for the `List<>` class are correct.

The constraints provided are interesting. For example:

```cpp
// Helper concept to simplify variant visitation
template <typename T, typename... Ts>
concept Contains = std::is_same_v<std::variant<T, Ts...>, std::variant<Ts...>> || Contains<T, Ts...>;
```

This approach to using recursive constraint definition is new to me. It is not legal, after testing with VS2022 Pro and Clang version 17.

That said - it was a novel approach to the problem. It even has some merit and with (much) work could be added to C++. Interesting stuff.

The generated code references a `clear` method that is not defined.

Similarly, it references `head_` and `tail_` and `size_` fields that do not exist in the generated code.

Similarly, the definition of the free-function "print" is:

```cpp
    // Iterate over the list and prints the data
    void print() {
        if constexpr (std::is_same_v<Types, std::string>) {
            print_impl<std::string>();
        }
        else {
            print_impl<Types...>();
        }
    }
```

Which references a function name 'print_impl` that is not provided. It is clear what the intention was however, and an intermediate coder could work with this no problem.
