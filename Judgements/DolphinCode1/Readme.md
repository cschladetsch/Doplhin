Write C++ code to solve the following problem: Given an array of integers 'a', 

find if there exists a subarray of length 'k' such that for every element in the subarray, 

there exists an element greater than or equal to it to the right, 

and an element greater than or equal to it to the left. 

If such a subarray exists, output 'YES'; otherwise, output 'NO'. You can assume that the input array is 0-indexed.
